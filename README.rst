Python library for making dynamic presentations
----------------------------------------------

Overview
========

I'm tired of slogging through LaTeX to code my presentations.  I want
Python and I want vector graphics.  SciPres was great, but is no
longer maintained.  This library seeks, in a similar fashion, to
transform the way you make presentations.  All low-level rendering
will be with Cairo, so creating beautiful and dynamic presentations
with vectorized graphics should be at our fingertips.

Now we just have to code it...
